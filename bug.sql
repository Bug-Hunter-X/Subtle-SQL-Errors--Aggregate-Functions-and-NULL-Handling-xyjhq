In SQL, a common yet subtle error arises when using aggregate functions (like SUM, AVG, COUNT) without a GROUP BY clause.  This can lead to unexpected results and possibly inaccurate data aggregation. Consider this scenario: You want to calculate the total sales for each product category.  If you forget the GROUP BY clause, SQL will return a single aggregated value across all categories, rendering the result meaningless for individual category analysis.  This might lead to wrong business decisions based on the incorrect total sales figures. Another subtle error occurs when dealing with NULL values in aggregate functions.  Some functions, especially AVG, will ignore NULLs; others (like COUNT) might include them.  This inconsistency can create errors in calculations, especially when using JOINs with incomplete data.  Without proper handling (using ISNULL or COALESCE), you may obtain erroneous aggregate results.
